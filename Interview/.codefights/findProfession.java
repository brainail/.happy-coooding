/**
 * Consider a special family of Engineers and Doctors. This family has the following rules:

Everybody has two children.
The first child of an Engineer is an Engineer and the second child is a Doctor.
The first child of a Doctor is a Doctor and the second child is an Engineer.
All generations of Doctors and Engineers start with an Engineer.
We can represent the situation using this diagram:

                E
           /         \
          E           D
        /   \        /  \
       E     D      D    E
      / \   / \    / \   / \
     E   D D   E  D   E E   D
Given the level and position of a person in the ancestor tree above, find the profession of the person.
Note: in this tree first child is considered as left child, second - as right.

Example

For level = 3 and pos = 3, the output should be
findProfession(level, pos) = "Doctor".
 */

String findProfession(int level, int pos) {
    int doctor = 1;
    while (--level > 0) {
        doctor ^= (1 - (pos & 1));
        pos = (pos + 1) >> 1;
    }
    return 0 == doctor ? "Doctor" : "Engineer";
}
