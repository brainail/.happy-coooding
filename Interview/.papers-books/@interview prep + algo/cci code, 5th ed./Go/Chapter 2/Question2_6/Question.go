    Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm which returns node at the beginning of the loop.

    DEFINITION
    Circular linked list: A (corrupt) linked list in which a nodeâ€™s next pointer points to an earlier node, so as to make a loop in the linked list.

    EXAMPLE
    input: A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> C [the same C as earlier]
    output: C

       Note: why are they both exactly k steps away?
       ---------------------------------------------

       let k be the num of steps from head to loopBeginNode
       let s be the num of steps from loopBeginNode to Meeting node
       pslow has previously travelled k + s nodes

       pfast been circulating the n circles in the ring (1 <= n).
       let r be the loop length
       then pfast has travelled s + nr to meet the pslow.
       Hence meeting point = (s + nr) = s { due to the loop }
       The total movement of pfast from head is k + s + nr.
       so from meeting node pfast needs to move k times to reach loopBeginNode.
       from head, k steps is needed to reach the loopBeginNode.
