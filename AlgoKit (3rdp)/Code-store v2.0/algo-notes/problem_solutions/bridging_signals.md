# Bridging Signals (POJ 1631)

The problem is just a equivalent of finding the length longest increasing subsequence from given subsequences
as if we only preserve the connection to endpoint numbered by items in that subseqence, there won't be a cross
among every pairs of connections. Also we can not find a larger solution to this problem.
