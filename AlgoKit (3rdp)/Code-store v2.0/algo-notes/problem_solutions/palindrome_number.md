# Palindrome Number

Check if an integer is a palindrome number without extra space cost (cost $$O(1)$$ as we at least need
another variable). So it is not allowed to turn the number into `String` with `String.valueOf(x)`.
This problem is in fact quite simple but one should take care of the cases that may cause one
or more variable's value exceed their type's limit.
