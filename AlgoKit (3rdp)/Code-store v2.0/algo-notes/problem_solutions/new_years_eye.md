# New Years Eye

This is a interesting problem. Instead of calculate the the amount of wite a bottle holds
at last, we calculate the total amount of wine that flows over a bottle and distribute
the flow of current bottle of this level to next level. At last, if a bottle has an amount of flow
that is greater or equal to `250.0`ml, the amount it holds at last is `250.0`ml. Or the amount left
is the amount of flow itself.
