# Rectangle Area

It is a simple problem. Given two rectangles, you are asked to return the total area of the region
the two rectangles cover. It is abviously that the result equals to the sum of two rectangles'
area deduct the area two rectangles both cover.

Some points should be kept an eye on:

1. You code must works on every different cases. For example, what if the two rectangle has not
insection area? What if one rectangle totally contains the other one?
2. You code should be able to work on different kinds of input. The rectangle is given by two
points on the cross. You should handle every possible relatively position of these two points.
For example, the two point can be top left and bottom right as well as bottom left and top right.
