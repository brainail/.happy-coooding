# Empirical Formulas

Here are some empirical formulas that may be useful when faced with interview questions
or algorithm problems. These formulas are mostly from *Programming Pearls* and it is
recommended that the readers have a look at related content and excercises in that book.

## Little's Law

Simply speaking, the law can be described as:

> The average number of objects over time in a system, equals the average rate the objects leave 
> the system minus the average time period each object stays in the system.

This law is usually used to estimate the capacity, leaving rate or average serving time when knowing
the other to parameters. Let's say the average number of objects is $$N$$, the leaving rate is
$$L$$ and the average serving time is $$T$$, then the law can be represented as:

$$N = L \times T$$

## Rule of 72

This rule is used to estimate an exponential growing variable's doubling time. Let's say some variable will grow
by $$r\%$$ in unit time and it grows for $$y$$ unit time, then, when $$r\times y\approx 72$$, 
we have the original variable's value will be nearly just doubled.

When $$r%$$ is between $$5\%$$ and $$10\%$$, the error of Rule of 72 won't be higher than $$1\%$$. There are
some similar rules such as Rule of 69 and so on described on [Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_72).

## $$\pi$$ seconds is a nano century

Yes, this formula is very simple: $$\pi$$ seconds is a nano ($$10^{-9}$$) century. This formula is useful
when estimating some program's runing time. Often it will be a bad program as the running time may be near
to tens of years. You should remember to come up with a better algorithm after estimated the time.

## Fermi Estimate

Fermi Estimate or [Fermi Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_problem) is an useful
method to estimate the amount of something with other related assumptions and known values.
The estimation usually need a [dimensional analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis) to
check the correction. Fermi Estimate can be used to verify if some data provided by a report or advertisement
is believable.

It is highly recommended by *Programming Pearls* that everyone should learn themselves this method and
have some exercises. It will be useful in daily life.
