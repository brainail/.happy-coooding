<h2 align="center">C++ Operator Overloading Guidelines</h2>

<p>
  One of the nice features of C++ is that you can give special meanings to
  operators, when they are used with user-defined classes.  This is called
  <em>operator overloading</em>.  You can implement C++ operator overloads by
  providing special member-functions on your classes that follow a particular
  naming convention.  For example, to overload the <tt>+</tt> operator for
  your class, you would provide a member-function named <tt>operator+</tt> on
  your class.
</p>

<p>
  The following set of operators is commonly overloaded for user-defined
  classes:
  <ul>
    <li><tt>=</tt> (assignment operator)</li>
    <li><tt>+ - *</tt> (binary arithmetic operators)</li>
    <li><tt>+= -= *=</tt> (compound assignment operators)</li>
    <li><tt>== !=</tt> (comparison operators)</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Here are some guidelines for implementing these operators.  These guidelines
  are very important to follow, so definitely get in the habit early.
</p>

<h3>Assignment Operator <tt>=</tt></h3>

<p>
  The assignment operator has a signature like this:

  <pre>
  class MyClass {
  public:
    ...
    MyClass &amp; operator=(const MyClass &amp;rhs);
    ...
  }

  MyClass a, b;
  ...
  b = a;   // Same as b.operator=(a);</pre>
</p>
<p>
  Notice that the <tt>=</tt> operator takes a const-reference to the right hand
  side of the assignment.  The reason for this should be obvious, since we don't
  want to change that value; we only want to change what's on the left hand
  side.
</p>
<p>
  Also, you will notice that a reference is returned by the assignment operator.
  This is to allow <b>operator chaining</b>.  You typically see it with
  primitive types, like this:

  <pre>
  int a, b, c, d, e;

  a = b = c = d = e = 42;</pre>

  This is interpreted by the compiler as:

  <pre>
  a = (b = (c = (d = (e = 42))));</pre>

  In other words, assignment is <b>right-associative</b>.  The last assignment
  operation is evaluated first, and is propagated leftward through the series of
  assignments.  Specifically:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <tt>e = 42</tt> assigns 42 to <tt>e</tt>, then returns <tt>e</tt> as the
      result
    </li>
    <li>
      The value of <tt>e</tt> is then assigned to <tt>d</tt>, and then
      <tt>d</tt> is returned as the result
    </li>
    <li>
      The  value of <tt>d</tt> is then assigned to <tt>c</tt>, and then
      <tt>c</tt> is returned as the result
    </li>
    <li>etc.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Now, in order to support operator chaining, the assignment operator must
  return some value.  The value that should be returned is a reference to
  the <em>left-hand side</em> of the assignment.
</p>
<p>
  Notice that the returned reference is <em>not</em> declared <tt>const</tt>.
  This can be a bit confusing, because it allows you to write crazy stuff like
  this:
  <pre>
  MyClass a, b, c;
  ...
  (a = b) = c;  // What??</pre>
  
  At first glance, you might want to prevent situations like this, by having
  <tt>operator=</tt> return a <tt>const</tt> reference.  However, <em>statements
  like this <u>will</u> work with primitive types.</em>  And, even worse, some
  tools actually rely on this behavior.  Therefore, it is important to return a
  <b>non-<tt>const</tt></b> reference from your <tt>operator=</tt>.  The rule of
  thumb is, "If it's good enough for <tt>int</tt>s, it's good enough for
  user-defined data-types."
</p>
<p>
  So, for the hypothetical <tt>MyClass</tt> assignment operator, you would do
  something like this:
  <pre>
  // Take a const-reference to the right-hand side of the assignment.
  // Return a non-const reference to the left-hand side.
  MyClass&amp; MyClass::operator=(const MyClass &amp;rhs) {
    ...  // Do the assignment operation!

    return *this;  // Return a reference to myself.
  }</pre>
  
  Remember, <tt>this</tt> is a pointer to the object that the member function is
  being called on.  Since <tt>a = b</tt> is treated as <tt>a.operator=(b)</tt>,
  you can see why it makes sense to return the object that the function is
  called on; object <tt>a</tt> <em>is</em> the left-hand side.
</p>
<p>
  But, the member function needs to return a reference to the object, not a
  pointer to the object.  So, it returns <tt>*this</tt>, which returns what
  <tt>this</tt> points at (i.e. the object), not the pointer itself.  (In C++,
  instances are turned into references, and vice versa, pretty much
  automatically, so even though <tt>*this</tt> is an instance, C++ implicitly
  converts it into a reference to the instance.)
</p>
<p>
  Now, one more <b>very important</b> point about the assignment operator:
</p>
<p align="center">
  <b>YOU MUST CHECK FOR SELF-ASSIGNMENT!</b>
</p>
<p>
  This is especially important when your class does its own memory allocation.
  Here is why:  The typical sequence of operations within an assignment operator
  is usually something like this:
  <pre>
  MyClass&amp; MyClass::operator=(const MyClass &amp;rhs) {
    // 1.  Deallocate any memory that MyClass is using internally
    // 2.  Allocate some memory to hold the contents of rhs
    // 3.  Copy the values from rhs into this instance
    // 4.  Return *this
  }</pre>

  Now, what happens when you do something like this:

  <pre>
  MyClass mc;
  ...
  mc = mc;     // BLAMMO.</pre>

  You can hopefully see that this would wreak havoc on your program.  Because
  <tt>mc</tt> is on the left-hand side <em>and</em> on the right-hand side, the
  first thing that happens is that <tt>mc</tt> releases any memory it holds
  internally.  But, this is where the values were going to be copied from, since
  <tt>mc</tt> is also on the right-hand side!  So, you can see that this
  completely messes up the rest of the assignment operator's internals.
</p>
<p>
  The easy way to avoid this is to <b>CHECK FOR SELF-ASSIGNMENT.</b>  There are
  many ways to answer the question, "Are these two instances the same?"  But,
  for our purposes, just compare the two objects' addresses.  If they are the
  same, then don't do assignment.  If they are different, then do the
  assignment.
</p>
<p>
  So, the correct and safe version of the <tt>MyClass</tt> assignment operator
  would be this:
  <pre>
  MyClass&amp; MyClass::operator=(const MyClass &amp;rhs) {
    // Check for self-assignment!
    if (this == &amp;rhs)      // Same object?
      return *this;        // Yes, so skip assignment, and just return *this.

    ... // Deallocate, allocate new space, copy values...

    return *this;
  }</pre>

  Or, you can simplify this a bit by doing:

  <pre>
  MyClass&amp; MyClass::operator=(const MyClass &amp;rhs) {

    // Only do assignment if RHS is a different object from this.
    if (this != &amp;rhs) {
      ... // Deallocate, allocate new space, copy values...
    }

    return *this;
  }</pre>

  Remember that in the comparison, <tt>this</tt> is a pointer to the object
  being called, and <tt>&amp;rhs</tt> is a pointer to the object being passed
  in as the argument.  So, you can see that we avoid the dangers of
  self-assignment with this check.
</p>
<p>
  In summary, the guidelines for the assignment operator are:
  <ol>
    <li>
      Take a const-reference for the argument (the right-hand side of the
      assignment).
    </li>
    <li>
      Return a reference to the left-hand side, to support safe and reasonable
      operator chaining.  (Do this by returning <tt>*this</tt>.)
    </li>
    <li>
      Check for self-assignment, by comparing the pointers (<tt>this</tt> to
      <tt>&amp;rhs</tt>).
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>

<h3>Compound Assignment Operators <tt>+= -= *=</tt></h3>

<p>
  I discuss these before the arithmetic operators for a very specific reason,
  but we will get to that in a moment.  The important point is that these are
  <em>destructive</em> operators, because they update or replace the values on
  the left-hand side of the assignment.  So, you write:

  <pre>
  MyClass a, b;
  ...
  a += b;    // Same as a.operator+=(b)</pre>

  In this case, the values within <tt>a</tt> are <em>modified</em> by the
  <tt>+=</tt> operator.
</p>
<p>
  How those values are modified isn't very important - obviously, what
  <tt>MyClass</tt> represents will dictate what these operators mean.
</p>
<p>
  The member function signature for such an operator should be like this:

  <pre>
  MyClass &amp; MyClass::operator+=(const MyClass &amp;rhs) {
    ...
  }</pre>

  We have already covered the reason why <tt>rhs</tt> is a const-reference.
  And, the implementation of such an operation should also be straightforward.
</p>
<p>
  But, you will notice that the operator returns a <tt>MyClass</tt>-reference,
  and a non-const one at that.  This is so you can do things like this:

  <pre>
  MyClass mc;
  ...
  (mc += 5) += 3;</pre>
</p>
<p>
  Don't ask me why somebody would want to do this, but just like the normal
  assignment operator, this is allowed by the primitive data types.  Our
  user-defined datatypes should match the same general characteristics of the
  primitive data types when it comes to operators, to make sure that everything
  works as expected.
</p>
<p>
  This is very straightforward to do.  Just write your compound assignment
  operator implementation, and return <tt>*this</tt> at the end, just like for
  the regular assignment operator.  So, you would end up with something like
  this:

  <pre>
  MyClass &amp; MyClass::operator+=(const MyClass &amp;rhs) {
    ...   // Do the compound assignment work.

    return *this;
  }</pre>
  
</p>
<p>
  As one last note, <em>in general</em> you should beware of self-assignment
  with compound assignment operators as well.  Fortunately, none of the C++
  track's labs require you to worry about this, but you should always give it
  some thought when you are working on your own classes.
</p>

<h3>Binary Arithmetic Operators <tt>+ - *</tt></h3>

<p>
  The binary arithmetic operators are interesting because they don't modify
  either operand - they actually return a new value from the two arguments.
  You might think this is going to be an annoying bit of extra work, but here is
  the secret:
</p>
<p align="center">
  <b>Define your binary arithmetic operators using your compound assignment
  operators.</b>
</p>
<p>
  There, I just saved you a bunch of time on your homeworks.
</p>
<p>
  So, you have implemented your <tt>+=</tt> operator, and now you want to
  implement the <tt>+</tt> operator.  The function signature should be like
  this:
  <pre>
  // Add this instance's value to other, and return a new instance
  // with the result.
  const MyClass MyClass::operator+(const MyClass &amp;other) const {
    MyClass result = *this;     // Make a copy of myself.  Same as MyClass result(*this);
    result += other;            // Use += to add other to the copy.
    return result;              // All done!
  }</pre>

  Simple!
</p>
<p>
  Actually, this explicitly spells out all of the steps, and if you want, you
  <em>can</em> combine them all into a single statement, like so:

  <pre>
  // Add this instance's value to other, and return a new instance
  // with the result.
  const MyClass MyClass::operator+(const MyClass &amp;other) const {
    return MyClass(*this) += other;
  }</pre>

  This creates an unnamed instance of <tt>MyClass</tt>, which is a <em>copy</em>
  of <tt>*this</tt>.  Then, the <tt>+=</tt> operator is called on the temporary
  value, and then returns it.
</p>
<p>
  If that last statement doesn't make sense to you yet, then stick with the
  other way, which spells out all of the steps.  But, if you understand exactly
  what is going on, then you can use that approach.
</p>
<p>
  You will notice that the <tt>+</tt> operator returns a <tt>const</tt>
  instance, <em>not</em> a <tt>const</tt> reference.  This is so that people
  can't write strange statements like this:

  <pre>
  MyClass a, b, c;
  ...
  (a + b) = c;   // Wuh...?</pre>

  This statement would basically do nothing, but if the <tt>+</tt> operator
  returns a non-<tt>const</tt> value, it <em>will</em> compile!  So, we want to
  return a <tt>const</tt> instance, so that such madness will not even be
  allowed to compile.
</p>
<p>
  To summarize, the guidelines for the binary arithmetic operators are:
  <ol>
    <li>
      Implement the compound assignment operators from scratch, and then define
      the binary arithmetic operators in terms of the corresponding compound
      assignment operators.
    </li>
    <li>
      Return a <tt>const</tt> instance, to prevent worthless and confusing
      assignment operations that shouldn't be allowed.
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>

<h3>Comparison Operators <tt>==</tt> and <tt>!=</tt></h3>

<p>
  The comparison operators are very simple.  Define <tt>==</tt> first, using a
  function signature like this:

  <pre>
  bool MyClass::operator==(const MyClass &amp;other) const {
    ...  // Compare the values, and return a bool result.
  }</pre>

  The internals are very obvious and straightforward, and the <tt>bool</tt>
  return-value is also very obvious.
</p>
<p>
  The important point here is that the <tt>!=</tt> operator can also be defined
  in terms of the <tt>==</tt> operator, and you should do this to save effort.
  You can do something like this:

  <pre>
  bool MyClass::operator!=(const MyClass &amp;other) const {
    return !(*this == other);
  }</pre>

  That way you get to reuse the hard work you did on implementing your
  <tt>==</tt> operator.  Also, your code is far less likely to exhibit
  inconsistencies between <tt>==</tt> and <tt>!=</tt>, since one is implemented
  in terms of the other.
