Often we have to deal with polygons whose vertices have integer coordinates. Such polygons are called lattice polygons. In his tutorial on Geometry Concepts, lbackstrom presents a neat way for finding the area of a lattice polygon given its vertices. Now, suppose we do not know the exact position of the vertices and instead we are given two values:
B = number of lattice points on the boundary of the polygon

I = number of lattice points in the interior of the polygon
Amazingly, the area of this polygon is then given by:
Area = B/2 + I - 1
The above formula is called Pick's Theorem due to Georg Alexander Pick (1859 - 1943). In order to show that Pick's theorem holds for all lattice polygons we have to prove it in 4 separate parts. In the first part we show that the theorem holds for any lattice rectangle (with sides parallel to axis). Since a right-angled triangle is simply half of a rectangle it is not too difficult to show that the theorem also holds for any right-angled triangle (with sides parallel to axis). The next step is to consider a general triangle, which can be represented as a rectangle with some right-angled triangles cut out from its corners. Finally, we can show that if the theorem holds for any two lattice polygons sharing a common side then it will also hold for the lattice polygon, formed by removing the common side. Combining the previous result with the fact that every simple polygon is a union of triangles gives us the final version of Pick's Theorem. Pick's theorem is useful when we need to find the number of lattice points inside a large polygon. 

Another formula worth remembering is Euler's Formula for polygonal nets. A polygonal net is a simple polygon divided into smaller polygons. The smaller polygons are called faces, the sides of the faces are called edges and the vertices of the faces are called vertices. Euler's Formula then states:
V - E + F = 2, where

V = number of vertices
E = number of edges
F = number of faces
For example, consider a square with both diagonals drawn. We have V = 5, E = 8 and F = 5 (the outside of the square is also a face) and so V - E + F = 2. 

We can use induction to show that Euler's formula works. We must begin the induction with V = 2, since every vertex has to be on at least one edge. If V = 2 then there is only one type of polygonal net possible. It has two vertices connected by E number of edges. This polygonal net has E faces (E - 1 "in the middle" and 1 "outside"). So V - E + F = 2 - E + E = 2. We now assume that V - E + F = 2 is true for all 2<=V<=n. Let V = n + 1. Choose any vertex w at random. Now suppose w is joined to the rest of the net by G edges. If we remove w and all these edges, we have a net with n vertices, E - G edges and F - G + 1 faces. From our assumption, we have:
(n) - (E - G) + (F - G + 1) = 2
thus (n+1) - E + F = 2
Since V = n + 1, we have V - E + F = 2. Hence by the principal of mathematical induction we have proven Euler's formula.
