Frobenius Number
@ http://www.cnblogs.com/drizzlecrj/archive/2008/05/01/922561.html

	To set n-(â‰¥ 2) positive integers a1, a2, ..., an, their largest male factor is 1. Seek to make indefinite equation a1x1 + a2x2 + ... + anxn = F there is no non-negative integer solutions (x1, x2, ..., xn), the largest positive integer F. This is referred to as a1, a2, ..., an the maximum number of non-table, denoted by F (a1, a2, ..., an). Can find some information about the Frobenius Number The wolfram on. In addition, a great many problems with the Frobenius Number, such as the Coin Problem, McNugget Number, 10.0 Stamp, Problem and so on. 

	First, when the figure reached 1 

	This case, any non-negative integer can be expressed 

	Second, when the figure reached 2, the introduction of formula 

	If (a, b) = 1, a> = 1, b> = 1, you can not use a * x + b * y (x> = 0, y> = 0) the largest integer 
	F (a, b) = a * the bab 
	And can not use a * x + b * y (x> = 0, y> = 0) the number of non-negative integers (a-1) * (b-1) / 2 

	Proof of this formula in many ways, can see the dawn of Yuan Hao " px + qy class proposition " 
	Another one to prove that you can see wiskey blog notes 

	Third, when the figure reached 3 to sort out some of the conclusions that I see from the paper. 

	3.1 F (a, b, c) <= ab / (a, b) + c * (a, b) - a - b - c, and c> ab / (a, b) ^ 2 - a / (a, b) - b / (a, b) was established. 

	Corollary 1: If (a, b) = 1, c> F (a, b), then F is (a, b, c) = F (a, b) the 
	Corollary 2: Let a = p * u, b = u * q, c = p * q, p> 0, q> 0, u> 0, (p, u) = (p, q) = (q, u = 1) of F (a, b, c) = 2 * p * q * u - q * u - p * q - p * u 


	Four, when the figure reached 4, I looked up the number of papers in at least some special cases of the following reasoning. 

	4.1 Let (a1, a2, a3) = 1, (a1, a2) = d, a1 = d * a1 ', a2 = d * a2', 3 Diophantine equation a1 * x1 + a2 * x2 + a3, * x3 = n all the solutions can be expressed as 

	x1 = X1 + a2 '* t1, - u1 * a3, * t2, 
	X2 = X2 - a1 '* t1, - u2 * a3, * t2, 
	x3 = X3 + d * t2, 

	Where X1, X2, X3 is a solution of 3 yuan indeterminate equation, t1, t2 for any integer, u1, u2 meet a1'u1 + a2'u2 = 1 

	4.2 Let (a1, a2, a3, a4) = 1, (a1, a2, a3) = a1 = d * a1 ', a2 = d * a2', a3 = d * a3 ', (a1' a2 ') = d', a1 '= d' * a1'', a2 '= d' * a2'', 4 Diophantine equation 
	a1 * x1 + a2 * x2 + a3, * x3 + a4, * x4, = n, all solutions can be expressed as 

	x1 = X1 + a2'' * t1, - u1 '* a3,' * t2 - u1 * a4, * t3 
	X2 = X2 - a1'' * t1, - u2 '* a3, * t2 - u2 * a4, * t3 
	x3 = X3 + d '* t2 - u3 * a4, * t3 
	x4 = X4 + d * t3 

	Where X1, X2, X3, X4, is a set of solutions of Diophantine Equations, t1, t2, t3, for any integer, u1, u2, u3 meet a1 '* u1 + a2' * u2 + a3 '* u3 = 1 , u1 ', u2' meet a1'' * u1 '+ a2'' * u2' = 1. 

	Corollary: If x1, x2, x3, x4, above Diophantine Equations as a set of solutions, easy to get 
	x1, x2, x3, is also above Diophantine equation solution. 

	4.3 in two of them 4 yuan Diophantine equation, if a1> = a2, a1 '> = a4, is 
	F (a1, a2, a3, a4) <= 2 * a1 * a2 * a3 / (a1, a2, a3) ^ 2 + a4 * (a1, a2, a3)-a1-a2-a3-a4 
	And when 
	a4> 4 * a1 * a2 * a3 / (a1, a2, a3) ^ 2 - a1 / (a1, a2, a3) - 2 * a2 / (a1, a2, a3) -2 * a3 / (a1, a2 and a3) 
	When 
	F (a1, a2, a3, a4) = 2 * a1 * a2 * a3 + a4 * (a1, a2, a3)-a1-a2-a3-a4 

	5, when the number n> 4 after, at least the following theorem 

	5.1 F (a1, ..., a n-1, an) = d * F (a1 / d, ..., a n-1 / d, an) + (d-1) an 
	Where d = (a1, ..., a n - 1) 

	5.2 F (a1, ..., a n-1, an) <= d * F (a1 / d, ..., a n-1 / d) + (d-1) * an 
	An = a1 / * b1 + ... + a n-1 / d * b n-1, bi> = 0 (i = 1, ..., s-1) are integers, equality , that is, F (a1, ..., a n-1, an) = d * F (a1 / d, ..., a n-1 / d) + (d-1) * an 
	Where d = (a1, ..., a n - 1) 

	Corollary 1: If an> F (a1 / d, ..., a n-1 / d), then F (a1, ..., a n-1, an) = d * F (a1 / d,. .., a n-1 / d) + (d-1) * an. Where d = (a1, ..., a n - 1) 

	Corollary 2: If (a1, ..., a n-1) = 1, an = a1 * b1 + ... + a n-1 * b n-1, bi> = 0 (i = 1, ... , n-1) are integers, then F (a1, ..., a n-1, an) = F (a1, ..., a n-1), In particular, when an> F (a1, , ..., a n-1), the conclusion has also set up 

	Corollary 3: Let ai = b1 ... b the i-1 b i +1 ... bn, bi> 0, (of bi, bj) = 1 (i not equal to j), (i = 1, ... , s), 
	F (a1, ..., a n - 1, an) <= (n - 1) * b1 * b2 * ... * bn-sigma (ai) 

	End in mind: 
	The Frobenius Number topic, I found the following two questions (other topics is welcome to add) 
	A new the Change Problem 
	http://acm.hdu.edu.cn/showproblem.php?pid=1792 
	Solution: This is the two-dimensional version of the Frobeinus Number, F (a, b) = a * b - a - b N (a, b) = (a - 1) * (b - 1) / 2 
	(Note: N (a1, a2, ... an) a1x1 + a2x2 + ... + anxn can not be expressed in the number of number of) 
	2. The Frobenius 
	http://acm.hnu.cn:8080/online/?action=problem&type=show&id=11012&courseid=0 
	Solution: This is the Frobenius Number four-dimensional version of a topic so that demand F (a, b, c, d) and N (a, b, c, d), which limits the 
	a, b, c, d in the range [0,10000], and only asked to return to less than 106 F (a, b, c, d) and N (a, b, c, d) If F (a , b, c, d) 
	More than 106, the output is -1. This subject can use the recursive get, we may assume that f [i] is true that i this number to a, b, c, d said, 
	Then F [0] = true, F [i] = F [i - a] | F [i - b] | F [i - c] | F [i - d] (i> = max (a, b , c, d)). Statistics the number of N (a, b, c, d) can be less than 106. How to solve F (a, b, c, d) it? To do the subject to see the sample output, F (a, b, c, d) 
	Is exactly N (a, b, c, d) twice the minus 1, and then contact F (a, b) = a * b - a - b, N (a, b) = (a - 1) * ( b - 1) / 2, just 
	F (a, b) = 2 * N (a, b) - 1. So they use 2 * N (a, b, c, d) - 1 to 106 for comparison, even after a (later discovered that there is a problem, is not a simple twice by a relationship, such as a = 3, b = 4 c = 5, d = 6, 1 and 2 can not be expressed, namely N-(3, 4, 5, 6) = 2, F (3, 4, 5, 6) = 2 and is not equal to 2 * F (3, 4, 5, 6) -1. Han in the end, I do not know :-(). solving F (a, b, c, d) In fact, we can limit the scope of 106 +10 4 or less, we can assert that, if found within 106 +10 4 can not be said that the number does not exceed 106, then the back of all greater than 106 the number can be expressed, and this should be well understood :-) evidence to the contrary, if a number can not be said, then the number minus a, b, c, d can not be expressed, and so on. 
	At this point, at least this problem is successfully solved. However, if the scope is removed, it is NP problem, it is bad to do that.
